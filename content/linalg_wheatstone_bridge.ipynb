This is where linear algebra can help us, because it is designed for solving systems of connected equations.

When $R_2/R_5$ is equal to $R_3/R_6$, there is no voltage difference across $R_4$ and no current flows there.  To measure an unknown resistance, you can replace one leg of the divider with the object to be measured (e.g. $R_3$) and a precisely variable resistor (e.g. $R_6$), like a winding of wire with a sliding contact.  It is much easier to measure zero current than to determine a precise value for the current (which requires more calibration), so the technique is to \"balance\" the bridge by adjusting $R_6$ until the ratios are equal.  Then, the value of $R_3$ can be calculated precisely from the divider ratio (easily measured) and the value of $R_6$.  Instead of relying on this simplicity, however, we're going to use this circuit to illustrate the use of matrix algebra to solve the whole system at once (as in the text). \n",

If we replace $R_6$ with a fixed resistance, we can calibrate the bridge so that $R_3$ can be determined by looking at the voltage across $R_4$. This means we need to solve the whole system with known resistances, as in the text."
