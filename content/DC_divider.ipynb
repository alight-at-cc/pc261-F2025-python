The divider itself consists of two series resistors -- that's it!  \nThe dashed resistor is typically called the \"load resistor\" or just \"load,\" and it the purpose of the divider is to provide a specific fraction of $V_{in}$ to the load ($V_{out}$).  Since the load is in parallel with $R_2$, what we want is to find the voltage across $R_2$.  The usual assumption is that the load resistor is large compared to the divider resistors ($R_L \\gg R_1,\\; R_2$).  In this case, the equivalent resistance of $R_2$ and $R_L$ in parallel is approximately $R_2$.   Now we have a series circuit, and the total current is:\n\n$I \\approx \\frac{V_{in}}{R_1 + R_2}$\n\nBecause total current is also the current through $R_2$ in this scenario, we can determine the voltage drop across $R_2$ using Ohm's Law: \n\n$V_{out} = I R_2 = V_{in}\\frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$.  The division ration is thus $\\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} = \\frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$\n\nIn practice, however, we are not guaranteed that the load resistance is high.  Work through the exercise below to see what happens when the load resistance is not high compared to the others.",

Start with $R_1 = 5000\\Omega$ and $R_2 = 5000\\Omega$ (2x divider) and plot the ratio as a function of $R_L$ on a log-scale x-axis for values between $R_L = 1\\Omega$ and $R_L = 1 M\\Omega$.  Here's some code that will be useful:\n\n    # Generate load resistance values of interest:\n    RL = np.logspace(0,6,num=1000) #spaces them nicely on a log scale\n    # calculate ratio here\n    # then plot\n    plt.semilogx(RL,ratio) #uses logarithmic x axis and linear y axis\n\n>Play with the values as much as you need to argue how much larger the load resistance must be compared to the divider resistors in order for the divider to work as expected.
